name: Croissant ML Dataset Metadata Building Blocks

abstract: |
  Building Blocks for the Croissant metadata format, a standardized format for ML dataset description.
  Croissant simplifies how data is used by ML models by providing a vocabulary for dataset attributes,
  streamlining how data is loaded across ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow or JAX.

description: |
  This register contains OGC Building Blocks implementing the Croissant Format Specification v1.0,
  developed by MLCommons. Croissant is a metadata format that enables dataset interchange between
  ML frameworks and addresses discoverability, portability, reproducibility, and responsible AI challenges.
  
  The specification builds on schema.org and is designed to be modular and extensible. It supports
  structured and unstructured data, hierarchical record sets, and ML-specific features like splits,
  categorical data, labels, and bounding boxes.
  
  Key components include:
  - Dataset-level metadata (extending schema.org/Dataset)
  - Resource descriptions (FileObject, FileSet)
  - RecordSet definitions (fields, data types, transformations)
  - ML-specific features (splits, labels, bounding boxes, etc.)
